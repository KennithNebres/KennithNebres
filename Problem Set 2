Problem Set 2: Custom Modifications Using ALTER Command

1.Add a New Column to Each Table: 

in teacher table add 'email'to teacher and 'credit hours' to subject



ALTER TABLE teacher 

ADD email VARCHAR2(50);



ALTER TABLE subject 

ADD credit hours NUMBER;



2.Apply a Unique Constraint: 



ALTER TABLE teacher

ADD CONSTRAINT unique_teacher_name

UNIQUE (teacher_name);



REFLECTION:A unique constraint ensures no duplicate values, like a Player ID, which keeps data accurate and easy to manage.
