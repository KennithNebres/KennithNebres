Problem Set 5: Challenge-Personalized Database Design Scenario with Unique Constraints:



Here's a personalized database design scenario based on your interest in managing a collection of songs.



1. Define Your Unique Scenario:

Imagine you are creating a database to  organise your favorite sports and your favourite players. 



- sports : this table stores information about different sports. 

- player: this table stores information about different players. 



This database structure allows you to organize your favorite sports and players effectively. 



2. Apply Unique Constraints:

To ensure data integrity and accuracy, we can apply unique constraints to the following fields:



- sports table: Ensure that each sports has a unique sports_id.

- player table : Ensure that each player has a unique player_name 



Here's an SQL example to define the tables:





CREATE TABLE sports (
    sport_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, 
    sport_name VARCHAR2 (50)UNIQUE
    );



CREATE TABLE player (
    player_id NUMBER , 
    player_name VARCHAR2 (50),
    age NUMBER UNIQUE 
    ); 





 3. Alter the Structure:

Suppose we want to add a position . We can use the 'ALTER' command to add this new column.





ALTER TABLE player 

ADD COLUMN position VARCHAR2 (50) 





Reflection:Unique constraints prevent duplicates, and foreign keys ensure consistent relationships, making data accurate and easier to manage.
